### Knowledge Workflows
- ideas are created or mapped first
	- TopDown: we start from the map and branch down to notes
	- BottomUp: we create knowledge notes individually and then create a make to make sense of it 

- calendar / daily note  
	- Could be a thinking pad for us daily, with an h2/h3 heading separation between our names added to the [[Template, Properties, Daily Note (Kit)]]
