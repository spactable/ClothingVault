### Markdown syntax
- Heading: `#`, `##`, etc. 
- Link: `[[]]`
- Codeblock: \`\`\`

### Important shortcuts

are these obsidian shortcut right for windows or are they off because i wrote them form my mac experience:   

*Primary*
- `control + M` - move a file from a folder to another e.g. `/+` to `/Ideas`.
- `control + shift + S` - opens the choose template ([[Template, Properties, Base]] for most notes)
- `control + D` - opens the daily note *with metadata and template pre-loaded* where we can think freely and leave it behind when done. it also acts as a shot-term history. 
- `control + P` - open the command pallet
- `control + O` open a new note
- `Alt + control + delete` delete a note

*secondary / editorial*
- `control + 1` or `2` - move selected text up and down
- `control + 3` - create a bullet / numbered list
- `control + 4` - open source mode making the file not render markdown

- `control + I`
- `control + B`

- how to select text on windows like how it is in mac `option + shift + right/left arrow` to select words or `command + shift + right/left arrow`. 

### Knowledge Workflows
- ideas are created or mapped first
	- TopDown: we start from the map and branch down to notes
	- BottomUp: we create knowledge notes individually and then create a make to make sense of it 

- calendar / daily note  
	- Could be a thinking pad for us daily, with an h2/h3 heading separation between our names added to the [[Template, Properties, Daily Note (Kit)]]
