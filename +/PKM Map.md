### Markdown syntax

- Heading: `#`, `##`, etc.
- Internal link: `[[Note]]`
- External link: `[text](url)` or `Ctrl + K`
- Code block: \`\`\`

### Important shortcuts
*If a key is uncertain, use `Ctrl + P` and search rather than memorizing.*

**Core navigation**

- `Ctrl + N` – create new note.
- `Ctrl + O` – Quick Switcher, open note by name.
- `Ctrl + W` - close tab
- `Ctrl + Shift + T` – reopen last closed tab.
- `Ctrl + T` – open new tab.

- `Ctrl + P` – Command palette.
- `Ctrl + ,` – open settings.


**Selection / Editing**

- `Ctrl + Shift + → / ←` – select by word.
- `Shift + Home / End` – select to start / end of line.

	- *with metadata and template pre-loaded- where we can think freely and leave it behind when done. it also acts as a shot-term history.

### Software workflows

- Create note (`Ctrl + N`) ***→*** write / create links (`[[` or `Ctrl + K`) ***→*** insert template (`Ctrl + Shift + S`) ***→*** move note (`Ctrl + M`).
- Open note (`Ctrl + O` Quick Switcher) ***→*** edit ***→*** navigate with links.
- When unsure: `Ctrl + P` Command palette ***→*** search the action.

### Knowledge workflows
Knowledge structures can be done in two ways. 
- **Top‑down:*- start from a map or index note and branch into notes.
- **Bottom‑up:*- create individual notes first, then synthesize into maps.
