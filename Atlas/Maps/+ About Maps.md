This's where we organize our [[+ About Ideas|ideas]] to link them, and see the bigger picture. this applies to [[+ About Business Docs|Business Docs]] as well.

- there're 2 types:
	- `#map` - aka MOC; where we manually structure a note that with links to organize other notes. 
	- `#map/view` - where we have data view or base queries that searches the vault and get the exact notes we want.

- MOCs can be created in two ways
	- **Top‑down:*- start from a map or index note and branch into notes.
	- **Bottom‑up:*- create individual notes first, then synthesize into maps.

this's an example of a finished MOC: [[Example MOC (habits map)]]

##### Examples of Maps of Content
- A digital note with a bunch of links to other notes clustered into groups.
- A desk with a bunch of index cards on it that you've clustered into groups.
- A map of almost anything: World maps, concept maps, even Google Maps.
- A detective's wall of suspects with strings linking people and objects of interest together.
